The programming language is Java. Java has a very large ecosystem. The most popular tool for linting is probably Checkstyle. It can be used as plugin in Visual Studio Code, Eclipse and other IDEs. For building, the prominent frameworks are Robot Framework and Selenium. Robot Framework is a bit newer and seems to be used a lot. For building, Gradle seems to be almost a standard.

There are a lot of options for CI. Most cloud computing provides have their own CI tools. For example AWS has AWS Code Pipeline and Microsoft Azure has Azure DevOps Server. They are run in the cloud and they require a little bit of effort to set them up. If you are looking for self-hosted tool to be run on-premises, the most popular options seem to be CircleCI, Atlassian Bamboo and Jetbrains Teamcity.

One of the biggest decisions is whether to use self-hosted or cloud based solution. Both have their pros and cons. One of the good sides of cloud based solution is that you do not have to worry about the "heavy lifting". This means that the cloud computing provider takes care of the servers, databases and other infrastructure for you. A lot of things are done for you under the hood but you loose control. For example, you have no access to the servers or the databases to troubleshoot things. In case of self-hosted CI, you have 100% of the control but you have to do the "heavy lifting" yourself. You need to manage the servers, databases, networks and other infrastructure yourself. This means for example that you need either on-premises data center or a service provider that provides you Virtual Private Servers.

For small teams and organizations a cloud based tool is usually the best option. Self-hosted tool is usually the best option for large organizations.
